Changes in version 3.7-SNAPSHOT.
-------------------------------

The font used by RRD4J can now be defined a set of properties. See the introduction of the class RrdGraphConstants for more details.

Fixing a small bug in canonical path resolution by the pool.

Changes in version 3.6 - 06 Apr 2020.
-------------------------------

Adding source for background or overlay image. They can be now an URL or even a custom generated image.

An image can also be added in the canvas (the area where the plot are drawn).

Dropped java 1.7 support.

Build settings to compile with latest JVM, but still able to run on the officially support JVM.

A new pool, using features from Java 8. They were some rare leaks in the old one and using modern java features should reduce locking.
It contains some assert so it might help discover problems early. All the public requestRrdDb are not deprecated any more, as they provide
a convenient way to get RrdDb using a pool.

* Fixed Issue 135: ByteBufferBackend.get fails with BufferUnderflow.

Changes in version 3.5 - 10 Feb 2019.
------------------------------------

This version include minor tunings, that should slightly reduce memory usage.

RrdGraph can now take a custom ImageWriter and ImageWriteParam for better control of generated image.

The class DataImporter is now public, it allows to define custom importer.

RrdDb are now made using a Builder, because of the explosion of parameters. The builder can also be used to define the use of a pool.

A RrdDb now remember if it was open directly or from the pool, so calling RrdDbPool.release is not needed any more.

The RrdDbPool is not restricted any more to files.

* Fixed Issue 123: Char arrays duplicates with ConsoleFun values in memory.
* Fixed Issue 124: RRD4j 3.4 increasing number of open files.

Changes in version 3.4 - 27 Dec 2018.
------------------------------------

This version is an important version, with many internal rewrite and code cleaning. 

Lots of changes in the RrdBackendFactory. Much finer control is provided, a generic close method is provided and backend factories now implement Closeable. Accessing factories
using the name is deprecated, and active backend should be used instead.
Many final was also removed. People using their own backend should have a look at the new code.
Backends now use more of Java's NIO and ByteBuffer API.
RrdBerkleyDbBackendFactory was the only backend factory whose creator auto-register as default. That's not the case any more.

Both LinearInterpolator and elements colors (in RrdGraphDef.setColor) now uses an enum instead of int.

All exceptions thrown by RRD4J are now subclass of org.rrd4j.core.RrdException, for finer exception handling.
But RrdException is a subclass of IOException anyway, so this release will not brake existing code. It fixes https://github.com/rrd4j/rrd4j/issues/102.

Added OSGi metadata to the main rrd4j jar. This is not supported on jdk 1.7. Added in https://github.com/rrd4j/rrd4j/pull/120.

A finalize override was removed in RrdDb, as it's considered a bad practice and now uses PhantomReference instead. It should reduce GC time, feedback is welcome.

In NIO backend, the sync threads pool is now optional. It was never really useful as the operation system take care of that anyway.

Changes in version 3.3.1 - 5 Oct 2018
------------------------------------

A rebuild of 3.3. Since Java 9, it's dangerous to build pre-9 java without checking against the old runtime.

Changes in version 3.3 - 28 Sep 2018
------------------------------------

Updated NIO backend to work on java 9+.
A few update to code from sonarcloud recommendations.

Changes in version 3.2 - 11 Nov 2017
------------------------------------

Better management of multiple backend of the same kind. To do that, URI can be used instead of path and the RrdBackendFactory can take a list of active backend that will be checked in order.
Each backend managed and generate URI using different kind of scheme. 
As URI is used internally now, it's dangerous to change the default backend once some rrd are used because it can change the internally generated URI. To avoid that,
either change the default factory once at the beginning or only use URI for rrd's path.

Allows longer that 20 characters in datasource names, the new limit is now 65535 characters.
A offset is encoded in the datasource name, using the private use area from unicode (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas). So if a long name is used and the rrd read
by an old library, the name returned will be the long name reduced to about 17 or 18 characters, depending of the length of the file, with a 
few undisplayable characters appended. But if this area is already used for some custom usage, some strange results will happens.

RrdBackend.setFactory should not be public it's not to be used by end user. But to late to make it private and final as it should be.

MongoDB backed end updated to 3.5.0.

Adding an experimental features, that try to downsample before rendering, see http://skemman.is/en/item/view/1946/15343 for rational. It's used
by calling RrdGraphDef.setDownsampler(). It must be given an implementation of DownSampler. Two example one, eu.bengreen.data.utility.LargestTriangleThreeBuckets and
eu.bengreen.data.utility.LargestTriangleThreeBucketsTime are given.

Findbugs run resolve somes bugs.

RrdDb is now java.io.Closeable.

Not yet ready for Java 9.

Changes in version 3.1 - 1 Jan 2017
----------------------------------

Added improved control on time label, by using custom instance of org.rrd4j.graph.TimeLabelFormat instances, thanks to brharrington (https://github.com/brharrington).
Added support for MAXNAN, MINNAN
The XML export format date use an ISO8601 like format, and output time in UTC.

* Fixed Issue 80: Error with resolution in fetch requests
* Fixed Issue 65: Fix crash when requested time is outside of archive range (for rrdtool archives).

Changes in version 3 - 15 Aug 2016
----------------------------------

Dropped support for Java 6.
Removed gradle and ant build.
Improved the RPN calculator performance.
Added support for VDEF like datasources. They are functions that take a datasource and output a single value. They can be user defined by implementing the abstract 
class org.rrd4j.data.Variable. A Variable class return a Value that can contain both a numerical value and a time stamp ; it's useful for functions like Max 
that can return both an maximum value and when it occurred. They deprecated old aggregation functions.
More precise font selection, with more configurable elements.
gprint can take any previously defined datasource that is a defined from a Variable.
Line, vrule and hrule can be defined using a java's Stroke, not just a float width.
Line and Area can be stacked at will, without the needs of a stack.

How to use the MongoDB backend (for more information see http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Java+Language+Center):

    // connect to localhost:27017
    Mongo mongo = new Mongo();
    mongo.setWriteConcern(WriteConcern.SAFE); // syncs write operations
    DBCollection coll = mongo.getDB("my-rrd4j-db").getCollection("my-rrds");

    RrdMongoDBBackendFactory factory = new RrdMongoDBBackendFactory(coll); // automatically set as default factory
    RrdDb rrdDb = ...

Changes in version 2.0.5
------------------------
* Reverted changes to Sample in 2.0.3 (binary searching broke storage)

Changes in version 2.0.4
------------------------
* RrdSafeFileBackend uses AtomicLong to track it's lock counters
* Fixed bugreport 2: in org.rrd4j.data.Aggregates.getAggregate(), the MIN case statement is missing. As
a result, gprint statements cannot display the minimum value of a data series as an aggregate function.
* Other minor changes

Changes in version 2.0.3
------------------------
* Major performance and locking improvements with the BerkeleyDB backend
* 10% performance improvement in the Sample class (now uses binary searching to get the correct datasource)
* JRobin RRD file compability
* Less synchronization in RrdBackendFactory
* Other minor changes

Changes in version 2.0.2
------------------------
* Minor improvements to RrdBerkeleyDbBackendFactory

* Applied patch from Renaud Bruyeron:
RrdGraphDefTemplate.resolveColors destroys COLOR_NAMES constant array, which breaks the parsing
of XML template file. Another issue fixed by the patch is that Util.Xml.getChildNodes() does not
filter out nodes that are not of type Node.ELEMENT_NODE - this breaks pretty much all the parsing
code in the *Template classes.

* Removed RrdException, replaced by IllegalArgumentException in most places
* Usage of StringBuilder to improve performance
* Sleepycat Berkeley DB backend (see http://www.sleepycat.com)
* Varargs where usefull
